# Bookkeeper bot
This is meant to be a cost saving / accounting telegram bot (or app in a distant future).
The code is open sourced, but for starters the bot itself must be self hosted. That said, I might change this in future.

Rough list of features I'd like to have:
- create categories
- add expenses manually
- sync up with bank accounts (primary I am going to support Revolut and Monobank (Ukrainian neobank) for now)
- show stats per week/month/year

Future:
 - mortage calculator
 - budget planner
